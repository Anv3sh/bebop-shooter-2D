# Bebop Shooter 2D [WIP]
A dead simple 2D space shooter built with a dead simple 2D game engine - ebiten.
This is just a hobby project for me to learn more about game dev and the intricacies

I have always wanted to build video games and know how they work since I first played Road Rash in my childhood. 
So here is my first game written in Go
